# Overview of the project
## Scope of the project Radio Meshnet
The aim of the project is the development and testing of a self-sustained radio mesh-network based on free radio standards like LoRa, Wifi, CB, PMR under reallife conditions to allow communities to communicate and transact economically in emergency situations, independent from the electricity grid and the internet. Therefore, suitable hardware and software technology is to be found, used, refined and developed. The theoretical planning of such networks is to be transferred to reality and the function and reliability is to be tested and optimized with large amounts of participants over long distances.

In the first step, a messenger app ("Communicator") and the necessary wireless hardware for LoRadio / WLAN / CB / PMR must be developed for the selected meshnetwork protocol Reticulum from Mark Qvist.

In step two, the actual project goal is sought.

With a large number of willing users and provided hardware/software, a mesh-network is created and the runtimes as well as the message loss will be recorded and statistically evaluated.

As a result, an assessment of the feasibility of real autonomous networks is to be carried out, which could lead to the subsequent successful implementation of an extensive emergency communication network, possibly Europe-wide.

In this network users will be self-identified with modern SSI/DID technology, to safely communicate and exchange information, goods and services to make it possible to survive in disaster situations with mutual help.

Therefore, part of the project is the possible integration of a low bandwidth tolerant blockchain into the network. This has never really been implemented at the moment. Suitable blockchains such as beam, grin, mina etc. are to be examined for this purpose.

If you have questions or want to join the effort, please contact us via Email and leave us a message. We appreciate any help and have made a repo for tracking those issues.

There you`ll find suggestions on things that need to be made in order to let our meshnetwork conquer the world.
## Roadmap and Milestones
### Step 1: Development of hardware and software for a radio-meshnet
    • 1.1 First alpha release of the Communicator mobile app as central enduser component on Android smartphones, Linux and Windows            
    • 1.2 Design of the Radio-Meshnet hardware device LoRadio868/169 for the Communicator app            
    • 1.3 Beta-release of Communicator app with group function, marketplace integration and payment option                   
    • 1.4 Beta-release of LoRadio868/169 device for Communicator app with optimized casing for use on smartphones.                  
    • 1.5 Design of a ESP32 WLAN for the Communicator app for a local high-speed Meshnet
    • 1.6 Implementing decentralized, anonymous user registration and identification/authentication with SSI/DID technology (database structure)
    • 1.7 development/implantation of decentral, digital blockchain with resilience against power/internet blackout  Mina, Hydra, beam for DID, registration           , identification etc??? External help.   
    • 1.8 - Development and implementation of a decentralized API-Console to the public Hydraledger blockchain with resilience against blackouts of power
            grid and internet
          - Optimizing Morpheus node performance for mass adoption of SSI/DID transactions
          - Implement python3 SDK for wallet, Hydraledger and Morpheus functions relevant to Communicator app
          - Meetings and competence transfer supporting integration of the python SDK
    
### Step 2: Real world test of radio-meshnet after app launch and recruiting users   
    • 2.1 Preparing and publishing developer and user documentation
    • 2.2 Optional: porting the mobile app GUI from the less performant python environment to a faster performing programming language
    • 2.3 Finalisation and public launch of 1.0 release of Communicator app with new LoRadio for smartphone use     
    • 2.4 Wide area test of the capability and scalability of the developed meshnet technology. With min. 200 users over large distances in urban and  
          rural environment.
