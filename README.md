# Overview of the project
## Scope of the project Radio Meshnet
The aim of the project is the development and testing of a self-sustained radio mesh-network based on free radio standards like LoRa, Wifi, CB, PMR under reallife conditions to allow communities to communicate and transact economically in emergency situations, independent from the electricity grid and the internet. Therefore, suitable hardware and software technology is to be found, used, refined and developed. The theoretical planning of such networks is to be transferred to reality and the function and reliability is to be tested and optimized with large amounts of participants over long distances.

In the first step, a messenger app ("Communicator") and the necessary wireless hardware for LoRadio / WLAN / CB / PMR must be developed for the selected meshnetwork protocol Reticulum from Mark Qvist.

In step two, the actual project goal is sought.

With a large number of willing users and provided hardware/software, a mesh-network is created and the runtimes as well as the message loss will be recorded and statistically evaluated.

As a result, an assessment of the feasibility of real autonomous networks is to be carried out, which could lead to the subsequent successful implementation of an extensive emergency communication network, possibly Europe-wide.

In this network users will be self-identified with modern SSI/DID technology, to safely communicate and exchange information, goods and services to make it possible to survive in disaster situations with mutual help.

Therefore, part of the project is the possible integration of a low bandwidth tolerant blockchain into the network. This has never really been implemented at the moment. Suitable blockchains such as beam, grin, mina etc. are to be examined for this purpose.

If you have questions or want to join the effort, please contact us via Email and leave us a message. We appreciate any help and have made a repo for tracking those issues.

There you`ll find suggestions on things that need to be made in order to let our meshnetwork conquer the world.
## Roadmap and Milestones
### Step 1: Planning phase
    • 1.1 Create requirements document + threat modeling, project plan with tasks            
    • 1.2 Create technical design, diagram as technical overview of all components            
    • 1.3 First alpha release of the Communicator app as central component                   
    • 1.4 Design of the radioMesh hardware Loradio for the Communicator app                  
    • 1.5 Design of the radioMesh based on ESP32 WLAN for the Communicator app for high speed Mesh 
    • 1.6 Implementing decentralized, anonymous user identification DID with database structure 
    • 1.7 development/implantation of decentral, digital blockchain with resilience against power/internet blackout  Mina, Hydra, beam for DID, registration           , identification etc??? External help.   
    • 1.8 planing of external security audit of encryption used in the network core
    
### Step 2: Pretest with small group   
    • 2.1 New Beta release of Loradio for Communicator with optimized outline/case for use on   smartphones
    • 2.2 New beta release of Communicator with group function  and payment option
    • 2.3 Real test with bigger test group

### Step 3: Real mass test after app launch and recruiting user      
    • 3.1 Process issues from external security review and results from beta test
    • 3.2 Publish developer and user documentation
    • 3.3 Optional: porting the app to new , faster programming language with external help
    • 3.4 public launch of 1.0 release of Communicator app with new LoRadio for mobile handy use (maybe before speed porting so save time)
    • 3.5 Wide area test of the capability's of real world mesh networks. With min 200 users over large distances in urban and open landscape and result               analyzing
